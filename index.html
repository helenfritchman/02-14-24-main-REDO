              The smell of toasted cheese, warm pieces and light notes of sesame
              beckon passersby to the Richmond District’s latest hidden gem.
              Tucked away on Fourth Avenue around the corner from Clement
              Street, Batches Bakehouse leads people to its storefront with the
              scent of freshly baked bagels and pastries. The business whips up
              about 25 dozen bagels a day alongside sandwiches, cookies and
              cupcakes. <br />
              <br />

              Co-founders Ashley Zografos and Ashlee Thompson were proud to open
              Batches Bakehouse on Dec. 1, 2023. For Thompson, this grand
              opening marks the resolution to a childhood dream. <br />
              <br />
                 “I’ve wanted to open up my own bakery since I was 13,” Thompson
              said. “I’ve kept a picture of a bakery I drew when I was 13 that I
              wanted to open someday; founding Batches is just a dream come
              true.” <br />
              <br />

              Thompson first ventured into the culinary world about eight years
              ago when she quit her job to pursue her passion for cooking. She
              developed her skills primarily in the Greater Boston Area, where
              she first worked as a bread baker for Boston’s Tatte Bakery. After
              learning how to bake bread, Thompson focused on baking pastries in
              Boston’s South End Buttery where she learned to bake cupcakes,
              brownies and the occasional wedding cake. Thompson then
              transitioned to baking as a pastry cook for a number of different
              restaurants along the East Coast. <br />
              <br />
                 “I picked up most of my cooking and baking skills from hands-on
              experience,” Thompson said. “I’m completely self-taught.” <br />
              <br />

              In 2019, Thompson moved to the Bay Area to further develop her
              skills as a pastry chef at Michelin-starred The Village Pub; she
              later worked for San Francisco’s Atelier Crenn and Victory Hall
              and Parlor. Thompson first met Zografos around this time. <br />
              <br />
                 “We had met through mutual friends, and the idea just came up
              one day,” Thompson said. “We just asked each other: ‘What if we
              started a bakery?’”
